### **2. Problem statement**

When the general public wants to see various information about the interior and pictures applied with the actual interior, the search range is so wide that they may not know how to search.
In addition, there are various terminology related to interior, so it is not easy to explain what you want or to understand what is fashionable these days without helping interior experts.

Therefore, out project provides a platform for self-interior people to easily find interior naver blogs that can be referenced through specific tags.
Since blog authors have attached appropriate tags to their posts, users will be able to easily find posts that contain the tags they want.
Users can simply view the interior information blog related to the tag by clicking on the tag related to the mood they want to decorate and also save or share what they like.

The ultimate goal of the user is to see the desired interior reference sites at a glance and collect them. 
So, the most important point of this project is how to effectively classify and sort tagged blogs. Also, detailed method implementation is needed for how to collect and add interior and suitable Naver blog.
